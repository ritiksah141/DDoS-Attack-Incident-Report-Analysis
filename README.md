## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a DDoS attack incident using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The project demonstrates practical incident response and security analysis in a real-world scenario.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Document and analyze a DDoS attack using NIST CSF
- Provide actionable security recommendations
- Demonstrate incident response procedures
- Create reusable security templates

## 🔍 Incident Summary

**Type:** Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack  
**Duration:** 2 Hours  
**Impact:** Internal Network Compromise  
**Vector:** ICMP Flood  

### Attack Details
- ICMP packet flood through unconfigured firewall
- Complete disruption of normal network traffic
- Network resource access blocked
- Business services affected
