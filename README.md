# NIST Cybersecurity Framework Incident Report: DDoS Attack Response

## Project Description
This portfolio project demonstrates the analysis of a DDoS attack incident using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). The analysis includes a detailed incident report and strategic recommendations for improving network security.

## Scenario Overview
A multimedia company providing web design, graphic design, and social media marketing services experienced a DDoS attack that compromised their internal network for two hours. The attack consisted of:
- Flood of ICMP packets through an unconfigured firewall
- Disruption of normal internal network traffic
- Inability to access network resources
