# NIST Cybersecurity Framework Incident Report: DDoS Attack Response

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how to create an incident report using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to respond to a DDoS attack. It covers the five functions of the CSF: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

## Scenario Overview
A multimedia company faced a DDoS attack that caused a network outage for two hours. The attack exploited a misconfigured firewall, overwhelming the network with ICMP packets. This repository contains an incident report analyzing the event and recommending improvements using the NIST CSF.
