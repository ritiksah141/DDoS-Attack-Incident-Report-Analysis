## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a DDoS attack incident that occurred at a multimedia company offering web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions. The analysis follows the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to document the incident response and provide recommendations for future security improvements.

## Incident Summary

**Type:** Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack  
**Duration:** 2 Hours  
**Impact:** Internal Network Services Disruption  
**Attack Vector:** ICMP Flood  

### Attack Details
- Flood of ICMP packets through unconfigured firewall
- Network services disruption
- Internal network access compromised
- Business services affected

## NIST CSF Implementation

### 1. Identify
- Asset inventory and management
- Risk assessment
- Network vulnerability analysis

### 2. Protect
- Firewall configuration improvements
- ICMP packet rate limiting
- Source IP verification

### 3. Detect
- Network monitoring implementation
- Traffic pattern analysis
- IDS/IPS system deployment

### 4. Respond
- Incident containment procedures
- Service restoration priorities
- Team communication protocols

### 5. Recover
- System recovery procedures
- Service restoration
- Security posture improvements

## Security Controls Implemented

1. Network Protection
   - ICMP packet rate limiting
   - Source IP verification
   - Enhanced firewall rules

2. Monitoring Solutions
   - Network traffic analysis
   - Anomaly detection
   - Alert system configuration
